**About the website**
*The king that never was*  
*Project created to apply what I have been learning in front-end development*

The website takes you directly to the game "THE KING THAT NEVER WAS," an immersive RPG experience. It provides all the immersion necessary to prepare you for the game in the future. We use React with TypeScript and the Vite library to extract as much as possible from React. For styling, we opt for the use of CSS Modules. The project is constantly evolving, with more updates coming soon.
