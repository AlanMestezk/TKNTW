"The King That Never Was" tells the tragic tale of King Eldrian, betrayed by his brother Malgrim on the day of his coronation. To save Eldoria, Eldrian cast a forbidden spell that killed everyone around him, leaving him immortally bound to his throne as punishment from the gods. While Malgrim rules with tyranny, a prophecy speaks of the promised hero who will wield the Shadow-Death Sword, challenge the tyrant, and liberate Eldoria.
