The website takes you directly to the game "THE KING THAT NEVER WAS," an engaging RPG experience. It provides all the immersion necessary to prepare you for the game in the future.

This project was designed to put into practice everything I've been learning in front-end development. We used React with TypeScript, and the Vite library to extract as much as possible from React. For styling, we opted for the use of CSS Modules. The project is constantly evolving, with more updates coming soon.
